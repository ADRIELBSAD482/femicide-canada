This bar chart shows the number of femicide cases across different world regions from 2008 to 2022. The Americas clearly dominate the trend with a sharp rise in reported cases between 2010 and 2020. This visualization helps establish that femicide is not equally distributed worldwide, and highlights specific regions that warrant focused policy or humanitarian attention.

This set of bar charts presents the number of femicides by individual country, grouped by region. Countries like Colombia, Brazil, and the United States stand out with significantly high numbers. These charts give a granular perspective within each region and help identify outliers and critical hotspots for targeted interventions.

The choropleth map displays a geographic visualization of femicide counts across countries. Darker colors represent higher reported cases. The United States, Brazil, and Kenya are among the most affected countries in terms of visual weight. This visualization allows quick pattern recognition of global distribution.


### Insight 4 â€“ Femicide by Age and Region (Bubble Chart)
