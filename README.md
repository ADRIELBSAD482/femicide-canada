# Executive Summary
This project aims to analyze femicide rates in Canada, with a focus on women and children. Femicide, the gender-based killing of women and girls, is a critical issue that reflects systemic gender inequality and violence. Indigenous women and children are disproportionately affected, highlighting the need for targeted interventions and policy changes.

For a deeper dive into the problem context, see the [Backgrounder Document](Background.md).

3. **Child Victims**: The number of children affected by femicide, either as witnesses or victims.
4. **Geographic Distribution**: Femicide rates by province or region.
5. **Data Completeness**: The percentage of femicide cases with complete and accurate data.
