*By: Adriel Uangbaoje*

## Executive Summary
This project aims to analyze femicide rates in Canada, with a focus on women and children. Femicide, the gender-based killing of women and girls, is a critical issue that reflects systemic gender inequality and violence. Indigenous women and children are disproportionately affected, highlighting the need for targeted interventions and policy changes.
