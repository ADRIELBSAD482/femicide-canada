# Background: Femicide in Women and Children in Canada

This project explores patterns of femicide in Canada using data visualization and exploratory analysis.

## Problem Context and Importance

Femicide, the gender-based killing of women and girls, is a critical issue in Canada. Despite being a country with relatively low homicide rates, Canada continues to see alarming levels of femicide, particularly among Indigenous women and children (Canadian Femicide Observatory for Justice and Accountability [CFOJA], 2022). Femicide is a manifestation of systemic gender inequality, deeply rooted in patriarchal structures that perpetuate violence against women (DeKeseredy, Hall-Sanchez, Nolan, & Rennison, 2021).

## Indigenous Women and Girls

Indigenous women in Canada are disproportionately affected by femicide. According to the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls (MMIWG, 2019), Indigenous women are 12 times more likely to be murdered or go missing than non-Indigenous women. This heightened vulnerability is shaped by historical and ongoing colonialism, systemic racism, and persistent socioeconomic disparities (Bourgeois, 2020). Despite comprising only 5% of the female population, Indigenous women account for 24% of femicide victims in Canada (CFOJA, 2022).

## Children as Collateral Victims

Children are frequently indirect victims of femicide—either as witnesses to fatal domestic violence or as casualties in attacks targeting their mothers. The trauma experienced by these children often leads to lasting psychological, behavioral, and social consequences (Jaffe, Campbell, Hamilton, & Juodis, 2014). CFOJA (2022) reports that children are present in 20% of femicide cases, either as observers or victims.

## Domestic Violence as a Precursor

Many femicides stem from prolonged domestic violence. Perpetrators are often current or former intimate partners, or family members (Johnson & Dawson, 2011). Although Canada has introduced laws and social interventions to address domestic violence, numerous women remain trapped due to factors such as economic dependency, fear of retaliation, and limited access to protective services (Wathen, MacGregor, & MacQuarrie, 2021).

## Systemic Failures

Failures in the justice system exacerbate the femicide crisis. These include insufficient victim protection, weak enforcement of restraining orders, and inconsistent or lenient sentencing for perpetrators (Kaye, Stubbs, & Tolmie, 2020). Furthermore, the absence of a standardized national framework for tracking femicide limits the ability to develop targeted interventions (CFOJA, 2022).

## Importance of the Issue

Femicide is not merely a criminal justice issue—it is a human rights violation and a pressing public health crisis. Addressing it is crucial for multiple reasons:

- **Human Rights**: Femicide violates women’s fundamental rights to life, security, and dignity (United Nations Human Rights Office, 2019).  
- **Social Impact**: The ripple effects of femicide devastate families and entire communities, leaving lasting emotional and financial scars (Brennan, 2012).  
- **Public Health**: Exposure to violence and loss increases rates of mental health disorders and perpetuates cycles of abuse (World Health Organization [WHO], 2021).  
- **Gender Equality**: Combatting femicide is essential for achieving gender equity and fostering safer environments for women and girls (UN Women, 2020).  
- **Policy and Prevention**: A deeper understanding of femicide patterns enables the creation of informed, data-driven prevention and intervention strategies (CFOJA, 2022).
