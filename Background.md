# Background: Femicide in Women and Children in Canada

## Problem Context and Importance
Femicide, the gender-based killing of women and girls, is a critical issue in Canada. Despite being a country with relatively low homicide rates, Canada continues to see alarming rates of femicide, particularly among Indigenous women and children. Femicide is a manifestation of systemic gender inequality, rooted in patriarchal structures that perpetuate violence against women.

### Indigenous Women and Girls
Indigenous women in Canada are disproportionately affected by femicide. According to the **National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls (MMIWG)**, Indigenous women are 12 times more likely to be murdered or go missing than non-Indigenous women. Historical and ongoing colonialism, systemic racism, and socioeconomic disparities contribute to this vulnerability. The **Canadian Femicide Observatory for Justice and Accountability (CFOJA)** reports that Indigenous women account for 24% of femicide victims, despite representing only 5% of the female population in Canada</mark>.

### Children as Collateral Victims
Children are often indirect victims of femicide, either as witnesses to domestic violence or as casualties in acts of violence targeting their mothers. The trauma experienced by children in these situations has long-term psychological and social consequences <mark>(cite)</mark>. According to CFOJA, children are present in 20% of femicide cases, either as witnesses or victims<mark>.

### Domestic Violence as a Precursor
Many femicides occur in the context of domestic violence. Perpetrators are often intimate partners or family members. Despite efforts to address domestic violence through legal and social interventions, many women remain at risk due to barriers such as economic dependence, lack of access to support services, and fear of retaliation.

### Systemic Failures
Systemic failures in the justice system, including inadequate protection for victims and lenient sentencing for perpetrators, exacerbate the problem. There is also a lack of comprehensive data collection on femicide, making it difficult to fully understand and address the issue.

### Importance of the Issue
Femicide is not just a criminal justice issue; it is a human rights violation and a public health crisis. Addressing femicide is critical for several reasons:
1. **Human Rights**: Femicide violates the fundamental right to life and security.
2. **Social Impact**: Femicide devastates families and communities, leaving lasting emotional and economic scars.
3. **Public Health**: The trauma associated with femicide contributes to mental health issues and perpetuates cycles of violence.
4. **Gender Equality**: Addressing femicide is essential for achieving gender equality and empowering women and girls.
5. **Policy and Prevention**: Understanding the root causes and patterns of femicide can inform policy decisions and prevention strategies.
